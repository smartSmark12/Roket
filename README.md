What is Roket?  
  Roket is a game, that I learned a lot from. Its a pretty basic a (very) badly optimized piece of code, that I made some "art" for.  
  You play as a space rocket ("Roket"), with which you must dodge all incoming asteroids and collect buffs to repair, reload and block.  

Basic controls for Roket: python edition:  
  WASD - movement  
  Space - play/pause  
  E - shoot laser  

How to install:  
  1. Create a directory (call it whatever you want, but "roket" or "Roket" is suggested)  
  2. Download ALL files from github to the folder you've just created  
  3. Run the "roket.py" file and install all requirements
  4. Enjoy!  

Please report all bugs and issues to this github page. Thanks!
