What is Roket?
  Roket is a game, that I learned a lot from. Its a pretty basic a (very) badly optimized piece of code, that I made some "art" for.
  You play as a space rocket ("Roket"), with which you must dodge all incoming asteroids and collect buffs to repair, reload and block.

Basic controls for Roket: python edition:
  WASD - movement
  Space - play/pause
  E - shoot laser
